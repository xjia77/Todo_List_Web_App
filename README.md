# Some key Points

The first step is to create the corresponding http (in views.py)  
Connect base to todolist by modifying urls  
Include base.urls in the base.urls  
Then models are created in database format and so on  
user  
title  
description  
completed/uncompleted  
Then it's time to migrate the data  
python manage.py makemigrations  
python manage.py migrate
